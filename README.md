## Requirements
Python 3.8 and above should work, but please do log any issues you have with lower versions as I'm open to supporting them

To install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration
Configuration can be specified using environment variables, which can also be declared using an environment file named `.env`.
Sample configuration is provided in a file named `sample.env`. You can copy this file, name it `.env` and change the values to suit your environment.

## Running the bot
This bot works by monitoring the log files produced by the game, so must be run on the same machine as the server/host

To run:
`python zomboi.py`

It may be a good idea to run as a service, especially on a dedicated server

## Docker

You will have to mount the maps and logs directories of the Project Zomboid
server into the zomboi container at the expected paths.

To build and run zomboi in a Docker container:

```
docker build -t zomboi .
docker run -d -v /path/to/maps:~/steam/steamapps/common/ProjectZomboid/media/maps -v /path/to/logs:~/Zomboid/Logs -e DISCORD_TOKEN=my_bot_token -e CHANNEL=channel_name_or_id -e RCON_PASSWORD=my_rcon_password zomboi
```

Or using docker-compose:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
