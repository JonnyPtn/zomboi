# Zomboi

A discord bot for dedicated project zomboid servers. Currently under heavy development, but any testing/feedback is welcome.

This is also an exercise for me to learn c# better so if you are experienced and wondering wtf is going on with this code, please share some knowledge with me :)

## Commands

- `/server` Server management (starting, stopping)
- `/create` Create a new server
- `/install` Install (or update) the server itself via steam
- `/players` Show details of the currently connected players

## Notifications
- User join/leave notifications

### Quick start

Copy the `zomboi.ini.sample` file and rename to `zomboi.ini` then populate with your desired values. Then run `dotnet run`
