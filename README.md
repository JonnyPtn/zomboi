# Zomboi

A discord bot for dedicated project zomboid servers. Currently under heavy development, but any testing/feedback is welcome.

This is also an exercise for me to learn c# better so if you are experienced and wondering wtf is going on with this code, please share some knowledge with me :)

## Commands

The bot makes use of slash commands for most things, so if you start typing `/` discord will show the commands available.

Features include:
- Server management
- Mod management
- Player info

## Notifications
- Players joining or leaving
- Players levelling up
- Chat mirrored from Global in-game chat (Only game -> discord mirroring, not the other way round yet)

### Quick start

Copy the `zomboi.ini.sample` file and rename to `zomboi.ini` then populate with your desired values. Then run `dotnet run`
